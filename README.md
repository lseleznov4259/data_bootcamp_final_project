Project Description 

This project will measure the number of active banks in the United States in 1984 and again in 2018. We will detail the downward sloping trend by exploring the main reasons for why there are fewer banks in the industry. Furthermore, we will assess the affect that acqusitions of banks by other banks had on the total number of institutions in the industry. 

The phenomenon of M&A will be analyzed in further detail after 1994 when The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act was passed. This law eliminated most restrictions on interstate bank acquisitions and made interstate branching possible for the first time in seventy years. The act permited bank holding companies (BHCs) to acquire banks anywhere in the nation

The key element of the project is the use of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Community Banking Structure Reference Data which documents why each financial institution entered or exited the universe of reporters between March 31, 1984 and December 31, 2018 will be used to answer the questions brought forth in this study. This uses the FDIC's extensive data regarding structural changes in the banking industry since 1984, enabling a full accounting of bank entry, exit, and other events that have reshaped the industry over this period.

The data will be used to showcase these main points:

1. The rate of community bank closures and openings from 1984 to 2018
2. The main reasons for why community banks had opened and closed from 1984 to 2018 
3. A detailed look at the institutions that have made the most (more than 50) acqusitions sinc 1984 and the methods by which they tend to acquire other firms
4. A closer financial look at the top acquirers 

The banking institutions that will be analyzed are available via their unique FDIC certificate number for the insured institution that either started or stopped reporting Call Reports or TFRs after Q1-1984.

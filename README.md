Data Bootcamp: Project Delivery 
This project will measure the number of active banks in the United States in 1984 and again in 2018. We will detail the downward sloping trend by exploring the main reasons for why there are fewer banks in the industry. Furthermore, we will assess the affect that acqusitions of banks by other banks had on the total number of institutions in the industry. 

The key element of the project is the use of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Community Banking Structure Reference Data which documents why each financial institution entered or exited the universe of reporters between March 31, 1984 and December 31, 2018 will be used to answer the questions brought forth in this study. This uses the FDIC's extensive data regarding structural changes in the banking industry since 1984, enabling a full accounting of bank entry, exit, and other events that have reshaped the industry over this period.
